# 🎄🎁 Advent of Code 2022! 🎁🎄
I am a noob to Go! This year I want to use the AoC as an excuse to play with language. Hopefully my code doesn't make those experienced with Go queasy!.

## Building 🎅🏻
I am leaning on some things I've built (for reading in a file), which are in the includes folder. This needs to be built first so the solutions can link against it.
```bash
cd ./includes && make
```

Each day is split into `pt1` & `pt2` with a `Makefile` meaning you should be able to run `make` in the folder, run the executable and it should just work™️.
